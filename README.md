## About

Taking inspiration from <a href="https://youngcreators.co/">YoungCreators</a>, I wanted to build a platform where small shop owners, small business owners, people giving classes (e.g. dance classes, boxing classes), can find workers for tasks that need to be handled. They can open a task on the platform and workers who think they have the knowledge to successfully complete the task can sign up through a form after clicking on a task.

</br>

After that the business owner and worker come into contact and can discuss whether the worker is a right fit for the task at hand.


## Key Features

* OAuth 2 - Secure way of gaining access to the platform, provided by Google
* Creating tasks - Open a task and let people know what you need handled!
* Worker search - Go through a list of the workers
* Reviews - Did someone do a good job? Leave a review so others will know!
